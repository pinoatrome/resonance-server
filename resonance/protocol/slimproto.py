"""
Slimproto Protocol Server for Resonance.

This module implements the Slimproto binary protocol used by Squeezebox
players to communicate with the server. The protocol runs on TCP port 3483.

Protocol Format:
    Messages consist of a 4-byte ASCII command tag, followed by a 4-byte
    big-endian length field, followed by the payload data.

    [COMMAND: 4 bytes][LENGTH: 4 bytes][PAYLOAD: LENGTH bytes]

        DSCO is sent by the player when its HTTP data connection closes.

        end-of-stream conditions.

        Disconnect reason codes (from LMS Slim::Networking::Slimproto):
            0 - Connection closed normally       (TCP_CLOSE_FIN)

        STMd/STMu (e.g. controller-class devices with transitionType=0),
